# Real-Time Secured Smart Space Monitoring System

## Overview

This project utilizes cloud technologies and IoT devices to monitor and manage room conditions, including light, oxygen levels, air quality, and occupancy. The system aims to enhance room management efficiency and user experience through real-time data and notifications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks light, oxygen levels, temperature, humidity, and air quality.
- **Occupancy Detection:** Monitors room capacity and triggers notifications when limits are reached.
- **Flutter Mobile App:** Provides real-time updates and a user-friendly interface for monitoring.
- **Data Analysis:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for trend analysis and insights.
- **Cloud Integration:** Uses Arduino IoT Cloud and Firebase for data storage and remote access.

## Hardware Components

- **Arduino UNO / Wi-Fi 1010:** Core microcontroller units for managing sensors and communication.
- **Arduino MKR:** Enhances system capabilities and includes sensors for environmental monitoring.
- **I2C Oxygen Sensor:** Measures ambient oxygen concentration.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors:** Detects occupancy by measuring distance to objects.
- **Flutter UI:** Mobile application for displaying real-time data.

## Software and Technologies

- **Arduino IDE:** For code development and uploading to Arduino boards.
- **Arduino IoT Cloud:** Facilitates real-time data monitoring and control.
- **Google Firebase Database:** Provides scalable storage and data management.
- **Flutter:** Used for creating the mobile application interface.
- **FreeRTOS:** Manages real-time operations and task segregation.
- **Machine Learning:** Implements linear regression and multiple linear regression for data analysis.
